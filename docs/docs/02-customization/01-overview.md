# Customization Overview

Stack offers comprehensive customization options for its user interface, available across three levels:

- [**Custom Color Scheme**](/docs/customization/custom-colors): For those looking to quickly align the interface with their brand while minimizing customization efforts, changing the color scheme is an efficient option.

- [**Custom Component**](/docs/customization/custom-components): Stack features a uniquely designed UI system that enables the replacement of any low-level components with alternatives of your choosing. This includes integration with various UI libraries such as MUI, Chakra, or any custom stayled components. You can opt for quick modifications by replacing prominent components like buttons and input fields, or undertake comprehensive UI customization by replacing all components.

- [**Custom Pages**](/docs/customization/custom-pages): For complete control over the UI, including alterations to the overall layout or the logic flow of pages, you can design your own pages. This can be done using Stack components or those from your preferred library, supported by our low-level functions to facilitate logic operations and server communication.

These customization levels operate independently, allowing any combination of adjustments. For instance, you might customize the buttons and input fields while retaining the default design for other components, and adapt a custom color scheme as a fallback for the look of the other components.
