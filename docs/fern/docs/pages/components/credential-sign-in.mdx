title: "&lt;CredentialSignIn /&gt;"
slug: components/credential-sign-in
---

A component that renders a sign-in form with email and password fields.

<div className="stack-white-image-showcase">
  <img src="../imgs/credential-sign-in.png" alt="CredentialSignIn" className="stack-250h" />
</div>

Note that if credential sign-in is disabled in the dashboard, this component will still render. However, attempting to use it will result in an error being thrown.

For more information, please refer to the [custom pages guide](../customization/custom-pages.mdx).

## Props

```tsx
import { CredentialSignIn } from '@stackframe/stack';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Sign In</h1>
      <CredentialSignIn />
    </div>
  );
}
```
