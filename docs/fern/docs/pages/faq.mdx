## Languages & Frameworks
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What languages are supported?">
    In the frontend, Stack supports TypeScript and JavaScript with Next.js. In the backend, Stack has a flexible [REST API](/rest-api) that can be used with any language or framework.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use Stack with other JavaScript frameworks, like Astro or Angular?">
    While you can use any backend framework with Stack, the frontend is tightly integrated with Next.js. If you want to use a different frontend framework, you will have to build the integration ourselves with the client endpoints of our [REST API](/rest-api). Some members of our community have started projects to do this, so you may want to join [our Discord](https://discord.stack-auth.com) to coordinate with them.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use Stack with the Next.js pages router?">
    Only the Next.js app router is currently supported. However, just like any other unsupported framework, you can use the client endpoints of our [REST API](/rest-api) to build your own integration.
