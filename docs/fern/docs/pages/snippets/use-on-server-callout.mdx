This is the documentation for a React hook on a server type. This is uncommon, because server types are only available with server permissions and React Server Components do not use hooks. Ask yourself if you:

- Want to use this on the server, eg. in a React Server Component? Look for the respective function without the `use` prefix (eg. `getUser` instead of `useUser`).
- Want to use this on the client, eg. in a React Client Component? Look at the documentation of the client type (eg. `CurrentUser` instead of `CurrentServerUser`).
- Are an advanced user, building an internal tool, and confident that you are securing `SECRET_SERVER_KEY` correctly? Then this is for you.
