## Setup

Internationalization with Stack is very straightforward. Simply pass the `lang` prop to the `StackProvider` component, and all the pages will be translated to the specified language.

```jsx title="layout.tsx"
...
  <StackProvider ... lang={'de-DE'}>
    ...
  </StackProvider>
...
```

By default, if no language is provided, it will be set to `en-US`.

You can choose which languages to use by employing your own methods, such as storing the language in `localStorage` or using the user's browser language.
