If you want to have full control over the layout and logic flow, you can build your own pages using our built-in components or low-level functions.

By default, `StackHandler` creates all pages you need, however, you can replace them with your own pages.

## Simple Example

For example, if you want to create a custom sign-in page with a customized title on the top, you can create a file at `app/signin/page.tsx`:

```tsx title="app/signin/page.tsx"
import { SignIn } from "@stackframe/stack";

export default function CustomSignInPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Custom Sign In page</h1>
      <SignIn />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Then you can instruct the Stack app in `stack.ts` to use your custom sign in page:

```tsx title="stack.ts"
export const stackServerApp = new StackServerApp({
  // ...
  // add these three lines
  urls: {
    signIn: '/signin',
  }
});
```

You are now all set! If you visit the `/signin` page, you should see your custom sign in page. If your user visits a protected page or the old `/handler/sign-in` URL, they will be redirected to your new sign-in page.

For more examples, please refer to the [Examples](/customization/page-examples/signin).


## From scratch

We also provide the low-level functions powering our components, so that you can build your own logic. For example, to build a custom OAuth sign-in button, create a file at `app/signin/page.tsx`:

```tsx title="app/signin/page.tsx"
'use client';
import { useStackApp } from "@stackframe/stack";

export default function CustomOAuthSignIn() {
  const app = useStackApp();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Custom Sign In page</h1>
      <button onClick={async () => {
        // this will redirect to the OAuth provider's login page
        await app.signInWithOAuth('google');
      }}>
        Sign In with Google
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Again, edit the Stack app in `stack.ts` to use your custom sign in page:

```tsx title="stack.ts"
export const stackServerApp = new StackServerApp({
  // ...
  // add these three lines
  urls: {
    signIn: '/signin',
  }
});
```

As above, visit the `/signin` page to see your newly created custom OAuth page.
