`TeamUser` is represents a user in the context of a team. There are two types of `TeamUser`

1. `TeamUser`
    - This is used on the client side.
    - It contains minimal information about the user, only the user's ID.
    - It contains a `teamProfile` object, which is the user's profile for the team.
    - You can obtain it by calling `team.useUsers()` or `team.listUsers()` on a `Team` object.

2. `ServerTeamUser`
    - This is used on the server side.
    - Currently it only contains the user's ID, but in the future it will extend `ServerUser`.
    - You can obtain it by calling `serverTeam.listUsers()` on a `ServerTeam` object.
