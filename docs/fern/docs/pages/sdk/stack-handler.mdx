The `StackHandler` component is designed to manage navigation for all pages under the `/handler/*` route. It serves as a wrapper component that determines which page to display based on the URL path and configurations in the `StackApp`.

<Note>
  By default, this component will redirect users to appropriate pages. For example, if a user is not signed in and tries to access the account settings page, it will redirect the user to the sign-in page.

## Props

- `app` (StackServerApp): The component relies on the configurations from `app` to determine the correct page URLs and handle redirections.
- `params` (object): This should be passed down from the parent component to relay any URL parameters.
- `searchParams` (object): This should be passed down from the parent component to relay any search parameters from the URL.
- `fullPage` (boolean): Determines whether the component should occupy the full page. The default value is `false`.
