slug: sign-out

The `SignOut` component automatically signs out the current user when rendered. It can serve as a dedicated sign-out page, ensuring users are signed out as soon as they navigate to it.

<Note>
  This component does not redirect a not signed-in user. To achieve automatic redirection for not signed-in users, you can use the `useUser` hook to check the user's sign-in status and perform the redirection if necessary.

## Props
- `fullPage` (boolean): Determines whether the component should occupy the full page. Default is `false`.
