title: useUser
slug: /sdk/hooks/use-user
---

This standalone React hook is an alias for `useStackApp().useUser()`. It only exists as a convenience; it does not have any additional functionality.

For more information, please refer to the [documentation for `stackClientApp.useUser()`](../objects/stack-app.mdx#stackclientappuseuseroptions).

## Returns

- `user`: `User | null` - The user data object if available, or null if not fetched yet.
- `loading`: `boolean` - Indicates whether the user data is currently being fetched.

## Example

```jsx
import { useUser } from "@stackframe/stack";

function MyComponent() {
  const user = useUser({ or: "redirect" }); // user is guaranteed to be non-null
  return <div>Hello, {user.name}</div>;
}
```

The same hook can also be used to protect a page. (You might also want to check out the server-side version [here](../../getting-started/users.mdx))
```jsx
import { useUser } from "@stackframe/stack";

function MyProtectedPage() {
  useUser({ or: "redirect" });
  return <div>You can only see this if you are authenticated</div>;
}
```

## Throw an error when not authenticated

By passing `{ or: "throw" }` into the hook, it will throw an error if the user is not authenticated. This can be used for places where the user should never be unauthenticated if the app is working correctly.
```jsx
import { useUser } from "@stackframe/stack";

function MyComponent() {
  // user is garanteed to be non-null, but an error will be thrown if the user is not authenticated
  const user = useUser({ or: "throw" }); 

  return <div>Hello, {user.name}</div>;
}
