`TeamProfile` is the profile of a user in the context of a team. There are two types of `TeamProfile`

1. `TeamProfile`
    - This is used on the client side.
    - It contains the user's profile information for the team.
    - You can obtain it by calling `teamUser.teamProfile` on a `TeamUser` object.
2. `ServerTeamProfile`
    - This is used on the server side.
    - Currently it contains the same information as `TeamProfile`, but in the future it might contain more information.
    - You can obtain it by calling `serverTeamUser.teamProfile` on a `ServerTeamUser` object.
