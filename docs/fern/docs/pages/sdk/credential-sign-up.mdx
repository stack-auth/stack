# CredentialSignUp

A React component that renders a sign-up form with email and password fields.

## Props

- `noPasswordRepeat` (optional): `boolean` - If set to `true`, the form will not include a password repeat field.

## Example

```tsx
import { CredentialSignUp } from '@stackframe/stack';

// Basic usage
<CredentialSignUp />

// Without password repeat field
<CredentialSignUp noPasswordRepeat={true} />
```

The component handles form validation, submission, and displays error messages. It uses the `useStackApp` hook for sign-up functionality.
