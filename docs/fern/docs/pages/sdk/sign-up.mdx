The `SignUp` component is a pre-built component that displays all the sign up methods available based on the Stack dashboard configuration.

<Note>
  This component does not redirect a signed-in user. To achieve automatic redirection for signed-in users, you can use the `useUser` hook to check the user's sign-in status and perform the redirection if necessary.
