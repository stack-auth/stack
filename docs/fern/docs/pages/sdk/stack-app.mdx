This is a detailed reference for the `StackApp` object. [Here](../concepts/stack-app.mdx) is a more high-level overview.

## Different types of stack apps

Stack offers two types of app objects: `StackClientApp` and `StackServerApp`.

1. `StackClientApp`:
   - Designed for client-side applications
   - Provides functionality like `signInWithOAuth`, `useUser`, `useProject`, etc.
   - Obtain it by calling `useStackApp()` in a Client Component

2. `StackServerApp`:
   - extends `StackClientApp`
   - Has additional capabilities like being able to listing all the users in the project
   - Access it by importing the object from the file where you created it (`import { stackServerApp } from '@/stack'`)

Choose the appropriate type based on your application's needs and environment.


## Initialization

We showed in the [setup guide](../getting-started/setup.mdx) that you can create a `StackServerApp` in a file like `stack.ts` like this:

```tsx
import "server-only";
import { StackServerApp } from "@stackframe/stack";

export const stackServerApp = new StackServerApp({
  tokenStore: "nextjs-cookie", // storing auth tokens in cookies
});
```

Except for `tokenStore`, there are also a few other options you can pass to the `StackServerApp` constructor:

### `urls`

An object that contains some pre-defined URLs that Stack uses to route and redirect. You can override them for your own needs.

Example:

```tsx
export const stackServerApp = new StackServerApp({
  tokenStore: "nextjs-cookie",
  urls: {
    signIn: "/custom-sign-in",
    signUp: "/custom-sign-up",
    afterSignIn: "/user-profile",
    afterSignUp: "/onboarding",
  },
});
```


- `home`  
    Default: `"/"`  

    The URL of the home page.

-  `signIn`   
    Default: `"/handler/sign-in"`  

    The URL of the sign-in page.

- `afterSignIn`    
    Default: `"/"`

    The URL that the user will be redirected to after successful signing in. Note the OAuth sign-in will distiguish if a user is registerd before or not, and not based on from where the user is clicking the OAuth sign-in button.

- `signUp`    
    Default: `"/handler/sign-up"`  

    The URL of the sign-up page.

- `afterSignUp`   
    Default `"/"`

    The URL that the user will be redirected to after successful signing up. Note the OAuth sign-up will distiguish if a user is registerd before or not, and not based on from where the user is clicking the OAuth sign-up button.

- `signOut`   
    Default: `"/handler/sign-out"`  

    The URL of the sign-out page.

- `afterSignOut`   
    Default: `"/"`  

    The URL that the user will be redirected to after successful signing out.

- `emailVerification`   
    Default: `"/handler/email-verification"`

    The URL of the email verification page.

- `passwordReset`   
    Default `"/handler/password-reset"`

    The URL of the password reset page.

- `forgotPassword`   
    Default `"/handler/forgot-password"`

    The URL of the forgot password page.

- `accountSettings`   
    Default: `"/handler/account-settings"`

    The URL of the account settings page.

- `handler`    
    Default: `"/handler"`  

    The URL of the handler root. If you want to change the URL of your handler to something other than `/handler`, you can change it here. 

    Note that you also need to change the `[...stack]/page.tsx` file to the corresponding location. When you want to use your website in a non-local environment, you need to change the handler URL in the Stack dashboard as well.
