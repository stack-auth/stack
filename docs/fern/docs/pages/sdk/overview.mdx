This is the SDK reference for Stack Auth's Next.js SDK.

For a list of components, see the [Components](../components) page. For instructions on how to get started and how to use the SDK, see the [Setup & Installation](../getting-started/setup) page. If you are using a framework or programming language other than Next.js, you can use [our REST API](../rest-api).
