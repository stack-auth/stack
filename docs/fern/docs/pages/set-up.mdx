## All in one, everywhere
Stack is reimagining global insurance benefits. Through our platform for developers, we're aiming to  increase access to complex, regulated financial products for an underserved customer. 

Our SDK allows you to offer local regulated and international health insurance within your platform along side our API which enables you to setup employers, employees, benefit enrolment and manage their billing, etc.

## Setting up Stack
<Steps>
### Contact Us
If you'd like to try our Developer SDK and APIs request [here](https://www.Stack.io/for-developers). 

### Access the API
To get started, you'll need to receive an `API Key` and a `Webhook Signing Secret` from Stack. 

### Start using Stack
Once you have your `API Key` and `Webhook Signing Secret`, you can use our [API Reference](/reference) to get started.
