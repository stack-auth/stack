Teams provide a structured way to group users and manage their permissions. Users can belong to multiple teams, which can represent departments, B2B customers, or projects.

To assign users to a default team upon sign-up, activate the corresponding toggle in the Stack dashboard under the team settings tab. This setting automatically assigns each new user to a team.

## Creating a Team

To create a team, use the `createTeam` method on the `stackServerApp`. Here’s an example:

```tsx title="Create a Team"
const team = await stackServerApp.createTeam({
  displayName: 'New Team',
});
```

## Adding a User to a Team

To add a user to a team, use the `addUser` method on the `Team` object. Here’s how:

```tsx title="Add a User to a Team"
const team = await stackServerApp.getTeam('teamId');
await team.addUser(user);
```

## List All the Teams of a User

You can list all the teams a user belongs to by using the `listTeams` method or the `useTeams` hook on the User object. Here's how to do it:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Client Component">
    ```tsx title="List teams of a user on the client"
    "use client";
    import { useUser } from "@stackframe/stack";

    export function DisplayUserTeams() {
      const user = useUser({ or: 'redirect' });
      const teams = user.useTeams();

      return (
        <div>
          {teams.map(team => (
            <div key={team.id}>{team.displayName}</div>
          ))}
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Server Component">
    ```tsx title="List teams of a user on the server"
    import { stackServerApp } from "@/stack";

    export default async function DisplayUserTeams() {
      const user = await stackServerApp.getUser({ or: 'redirect' });
      const teams = await user.listTeams();

      return (
        <div>
          {teams.map(team => (
            <div key={team.id}>{team.displayName}</div>
          ))}
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Get Specific Team of a User

To obtain details of a specific team a user belongs to, use the `getTeam` method or `useTeam` hook. Note: this might return `null` if the user is not a member of that team. Here’s an example:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Client Component">
    ```tsx title="Get a specific team of a user on the client"
    "use client";
    import { useUser } from "@stackframe/stack";

    export function DisplayUserTeam(props: { teamId: string }) {
      const user = useUser({ or: 'redirect' });
      const team = user.useTeam(props.teamId);

      return (
        <div>
          {team ? team.displayName : 'Not a member of this team'}
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Server Component">
    ```tsx title="Get a specific team of a user on the server"
    import { stackServerApp } from "@/stack";

    export default async function DisplayUserTeam(props: { teamId: string }) {
      const user = await stackServerApp.getUser({ or: 'redirect' });
      const team = await user.getTeam(props.teamId);

      return (
        <div>
          {team ? team.displayName : 'Not a member of this team'}
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## List All the Teams

To list all teams, use the `listTeams` method on the `stackServerApp`. Here’s an example:

```tsx
const teams = await stackServerApp.listTeams();
```

## Update a Team

To update a team, use the `update` method on a server-side team object. Here’s how to do it:

```tsx
const team = await stackServerApp.getTeam('teamId');
await team.update({
  displayName: 'New Team Name',
});
```

## Remove a User from a Team

To remove a user from a team, use the `removeUser` method on the `team` object. Here's an example:

```tsx
const team = await stackServerApp.getTeam(teamId);
await team?.removeUser(userId);
```

## List All the Members of a Team

To list all the members of a team, use the `listMembers` method on a server-side team object. Note that the returned result is a list of `TeamMember` objects, from which you can also get the user object. Here’s an example:

```tsx
const team = await stackServerApp.getTeam('teamId');
const members = await team.listMembers();
for (const member of members) {
  const user = member.user;
  console.log(`${user.displayName} is a member of ${team.displayName}`);
}
```
