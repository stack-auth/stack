Webhooks are a powerful way to keep your backend in sync with Stack. They allow you to receive real-time updates when events occur in your Stack project, such as when a user or team is created, updated, or deleted.

## Setting up Webhooks

In the Stack dashboard, you can create a webhook endpoint in the "Webhooks" section. After creating this endpoint with your server URL, you will start receiving POST requests with a JSON payload at that endpoint. The event payload will look something like this:

```json
{
  "event": "team.created",
  "data": {
    "id": "2209422a-eef7-4668-967d-be79409972c5",
    "display_name": "My Team"
  }
}
```

## Verifying Webhooks

To ensure the webhook is coming from Stack (and not from a malicious actor) and is not prone to replay attacks, you should verify the request. Stack signs the webhook payload with a secret key that you can find in the endpoint details on the dashboard. You can verify the signature using the Svix client library. Check out the [Svix documentation](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/how) for instructions on how to verify the signature in JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and other languages.

If you do not want to install the Svix client library or are using a language that is not supported, you can [verify the signature manually](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/how-manual).

## Event Types

Please refer to the webhook endpoint API reference for more details on the available event types and their payload structures.
