Webhooks are a powerful way to keep your backend in sync with Stack. They allow you to receive real-time updates when events occur in your Stack project, such as when a user or team is created, updated, or deleted.

For more information and a list of all webhooks, please refer to the [webhook API reference](/rest-api/webhooks).

## Setting up webhooks

In the Stack dashboard, you can create a webhook endpoint in the "Webhooks" section. After creating this endpoint with your server URL, you will start receiving POST requests with a JSON payload at that endpoint. The event payload will look something like this:

```json
{
  "type": "team.created",
  "data": {
    "id": "2209422a-eef7-4668-967d-be79409972c5",
    "display_name": "My Team",
    ...
  }
}
```

## Testing webhooks locally

You can use services like [Svix Playground](https://www.svix.com/play/) or [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) to test the receiving of webhooks or relay them to your local development environment.

## Verifying webhooks

To ensure the webhook is coming from Stack (and not from a malicious actor) and is not prone to replay attacks, you should verify the request. 

Stack signs the webhook payload with a secret key that you can find in the endpoint details on the dashboard. You can verify the signature using the Svix client library. Check out the [Svix documentation](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/how) for instructions on how to verify the signature in JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and other languages. Here is an quick example in JavaScript:

```jsx
import { Webhook } from "svix";

const secret = "<from the dashboard>";
const headers = {
  "svix-id": "<from the webhook request headers>",
  "svix-timestamp": "<from the webhook request headers>",
  "svix-signature": "<from the webhook request headers>",
};
const payload = "<the webhook request body>";

const wh = new Webhook(secret);
// Throws on error, returns the verified content on success
const payload = wh.verify(payload, headers);
```

If you do not want to install the Svix client library or are using a language that is not supported, you can [verify the signature manually](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/how-manual).

## Event types

Please refer to the webhook endpoint API reference for more details on the available event types and their payload structures.

## Examples

Some members of the community have shared their webhook implementations. For example, [here is an example by Clark Gredo√±a](https://gist.github.com/clarkg/56ffad44949826ae3efe0a431b6021c4) that validates the Webhook schema and update a database user.
