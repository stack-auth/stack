Teams are a structured way to group users and manage their permissions. Users can belong to multiple teams at the same time, so they can represent departments, B2B customers, or projects.

## Creating a team

To create a team and add/remove users, use the `createTeam` function on `stackServerApp`:

```tsx
const team = await stackServerApp.createTeam({
  displayName: 'New Team',
});
await team.update({
  displayName: 'New Team Name',
});

// you can retrieve the team by its ID:
const sameTeam = await stackServerApp.getTeam(team.id);
// or list all teams that exist on the entire app:
const allTeams = await stackServerApp.listTeams();
```

## Managing users

You can add, remove and list users on a [`ServerTeam`](/concepts/stack-app#client-vs-server):

```tsx
const allUsers = await team.listUsers();
await team.addUser(user);
await team.removeUser(user);
```

## Retrieving a user's teams

You can list all teams that a user is a member of with the `listTeams` or `useTeams` functions, or get a specific one with `getTeam` or `useTeam`. This works on clients and servers.
