subtitle: The most important object of your Stack project

By now, you may have seen the `useApp()` hook and the `stackServerApp` variable. Both return a `StackApp`, of type `StackClientApp` and `StackServerApp` respectively.

Nearly all of Stack's functionality is on your `StackApp` object. Think of this object as the "connection" from your code to Stack's servers. Each app is always associated with one specific project ID (by default the one found in your environment variables).

There is also a page on [StackApp](../sdk/stack-app) in the SDK reference, which lists all available functions.

## `getXyz`/`listXyz` vs. `useXyz`

You will see that most of the asynchronous functions on `StackApp` come in two flavors: `getXyz`/`listXyz` and `useXyz`. The former are asynchronous fetching functions which return a `Promise`, while the latter are React hooks that [suspend](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) the current component until the data is available.

Normally, you would choose between the two based on whether you are in a React Server Component or a React Client Component. However, there are some scenarios where you use `getXyz` on the client, for example as the callback of an `onClick` handler.

## Client vs. server

`StackClientApp` is the app which contains everything needed to build a frontend application, for example the own user object. It requires a publishable client key in its initialization (usually set by the `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PUBLISHABLE_CLIENT_KEY` environment variable).

`StackServerApp` has all the functionality of `StackClientApp`, but also some server-only functions, eg. listing or modifying ALL users. This requires a secret server key (usually set by the `STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY` environment variable), which **must always be kept secret**.

There is also a third type, `StackAdminApp`, but it is rarely used. It is meant for internal tools that have special requirements, and can edit the Stack project configuration. This is useful for configuring Stack programmatically, for example with Terraform.

Some of the functions have different return types; for example, `StackClientApp.getUser()` returns a `Promise<User>` while `StackServerApp.getUser()` returns a `Promise<ServerUser>`. The `Server` or `Admin` prefixes indicates that the object contains server-/admin-only functionality respectively.
