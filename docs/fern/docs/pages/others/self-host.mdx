subtitle: Self-host Stack Auth on your own server
---

Stack Auth is fully open-source and can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure. This guide will introduce each component of the project and how to set them up.

<Note>
If you are unsure whether you should self-host, here are some things to consider:

- **Complexity**: Stack Auth is a complex project with many interdependent services. Self-hosting requires managing these services and ensuring they work together seamlessly.
- **Updates**: Stack Auth is a rapidly evolving project with frequent feature and fix releases. Self-hosting requires you to manage updates and apply them timely.
- **Reliability**: Self-hosting requires you to ensure the reliability of your infrastructure. Downtimes and outages can be costly to handle.
- **Security**: Self-hosting requires ensuring the security of your infrastructure. A compromised service can affect your users.

For most users, we recommend using [Stack Auth's cloud hosted solution](https://app.stack-auth.com). However, if you understand the above challenges and are comfortable managing them, follow the instructions below to self-host!
</Note>

## Services

On a high level, Stack Auth is composed of the following services:
- **API backend**: The core of Stack Auth, providing the REST API that the dashboard and your app connect to. This is what [api.stack-auth.com](https://api.stack-auth.com) provides.
- **Dashboard**: The interface for managing users, teams, auth methods, etc. This is available at [app.stack-auth.com](https://app.stack-auth.com).
- **Client SDK**: An SDK used to connect your app to the Stack Auth API backend, wrapping API calls and providing easy-to-use interfaces. More details [here](/getting-started/setup).
- **Postgres database**: Used to store all user data. We use [Prisma](https://prisma.io) as the ORM and manage the database schema migrations.
- **Svix**: Used to send webhooks. Svix is open-source and can be self-hosted, but also offers a cloud hosted solution. More on Svix [here](https://svix.com)
- **Email server**: We use [Inbucket](https://inbucket.org) as a local email server for development and a separate SMTP server for production. Any email service supporting SMTP will work.

## Run with Docker

Stack Auth provides a pre-configured Docker image that bundles the dashboard and API backend into a single container. To complete the setup, you'll need to provide your own PostgreSQL database, and optionally configure an email server and Svix instance for webhooks.

First, you need to get the [example environment file](https://github.com/stack-auth/stack/tree/main/docker/server/.env.example) and modify it to your needs. See the [full template here](https://github.com/stack-auth/stack/blob/dev/docker/server/.env).

```sh
# Start a example Postgres database, don't use this setting in production
docker run -d --name db -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRES_DB=stackframe -p 5432:5432 postgres:latest

# Run the Docker container
docker run --env-file your-env-file.env -p 8101:8101 -p 8102:8102 stackauth/server:latest
```

Now you can open the dashboard at [http://localhost:8101](http://localhost:8101) and the API backend on port 8102.

Now, login with your admin account on the dashboard and follow the [normal setup process](/getting-started/setup). Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com` to your app's environment variables so that it connects to your API backend instead of the default Stack Auth API backend (https://api.stack-auth.com).

## Local development

### Setup

Clone the repository and check out the directory:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:stack-auth/stack.git
cd stack
```

Pre-populated `.env` files for the setup below are available and used by default in `.env.development` in each package. Copy all the `.env.development` files to `.env.local` in the respective packages for local development.

In a terminal, start the dependencies (Postgres and Inbucket) as Docker containers:

```sh
docker compose -f dependencies.compose.yaml up
```

Then open a new terminal:

```sh
pnpm install

# Build everything once
pnpm run build

# Initialize the database and seed it with some data
pnpm prisma db push
pnpm prisma db seed

# Run code generation (repeat this after e.g., changing the Prisma schema). This is part of the build script but faster.
pnpm run codegen

# Start the dev server
pnpm run dev

# In a different terminal, run tests in watch mode
pnpm run test
```

You can now open the dashboard at [http://localhost:8101](http://localhost:8101), the API on port 8102, a demo on port 8103, docs on port 8104, Inbucket (emails) on port 8105, and Prisma Studio on port 8106.

Your IDE may show errors on all `@stackframe/XYZ` imports. To fix this, restart the TypeScript language server; for example, in VSCode, you can open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run `Developer: Reload Window` or `TypeScript: Restart TS server`.

### Database migrations

If you make changes to the Prisma schema, you need to run the following command to create a migration:

```sh
pnpm run prisma migrate dev
```

## Run individual services

### Database, Svix, email

Deploy these services with your preferred platform. Copy the URLs/API keysâ€”you'll need them in the next step.

### API backend

Clone the repository and check out the root directory:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:stack-auth/stack.git
cd stack
```

Set all the necessary environment variables (you can check out `apps/backend/.env`). Note that `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_API_URL` should be the URL of your deployed domain (e.g., https://your-backend-url.com).

Build and start the server:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build:backend
pnpm start:backend
```

### Dashboard

Clone the repository (if you are running it on a separate server, or skip this step if you are using the same server as the API backend) and check out the dashboard directory:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:stack-auth/stack.git
cd stack
```

Set all the necessary environment variables (you can check out `apps/dashboard/.env`). Note that `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_API_URL` should be the URL of your deployed backend (e.g., https://your-backend-url.com).

Build and start the server:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build:dashboard
pnpm start:dashboard
```

### Initialize the database

You need to initialize the database with the following command with the backend environment variables set:

```sh
pnpm prisma migrate deploy
```

The database is still empty; you need to create a project with the ID "internal" used by the dashboard to authenticate itself. You can do this with the following command:

```sh
pnpm prisma db seed
```

Now you can go to the dashboard (e.g., https://your-dashboard-url.com) and sign up for an account.

To manage your dashboard configs with this account, manually go into the database, find the user you just created, and add `{ managedProjectIds: ["internal"] }` to the `serverMetadata` jsonb column.

Go back to the dashboard, refresh the page, and you should see the "Stack Dashboard" project. We recommend disabling new user sign-ups to your internal project to avoid unauthorized account and project creations.

Now, create a new project for your app and follow the [normal setup process](/getting-started/setup). Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com` to your app's environment variables so that it connects to your API backend instead of the default Stack Auth API backend (https://api.stack-auth.com).
