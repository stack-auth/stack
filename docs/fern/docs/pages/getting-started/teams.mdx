Teams provide a structured way to group users and manage their permissions. Users can belong to multiple teams, which can represent departments, B2B customers, or projects.

To assign users to a default team upon sign-up, activate the corresponding toggle in the Stack dashboard under the team settings tab. This setting automatically assigns each new user to a team.

## Teams

### Creating a Team

To create a team, you can call the `createTeam` method on the `stackServerApp`. Here is an example:

```tsx title="Create a Team"
const team = await stackServerApp.createTeam({
  displayName: 'New Team',
});
```

### Adding a User to a Team

To add a user to a team, you can call the `addUser` method on the `Team` object. Here is an example:

```tsx title="Add a User to a Team"
const team = await stackServerApp.getTeam('teamId');
await team.addUser(user);
```

### List All the Teams of a User

You can list all the teams a user belongs to by using the `listTeams` method or `useTeams` hook on the User object. Here is how you can do it:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Client Component">
    ```tsx focus={5-10} title="List teams of a user on the client"
    "use client";
    import { useUser } from "@stackframe/stack";

    export function DisplayUserTeams() {
      const user = useUser({ or: 'redirect' });
      const teams = user.useTeams();

      return <div>
        {teams.map(team => <div key={team.id}>{team.displayName}</div>)}
      </div>;
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Server Component">
    ```tsx focus={4-9} title="List teams of a user on the server"
    import { stackServerApp } from "@/stack";

    export default async function DisplayUserTeams() {
      const user = await stackServerApp.getUser({ or: 'redirect' });
      const teams = await user.listTeams();

      return <div>
        {teams.map(team => <div key={team.id}>{team.displayName}</div>)}
      </div>;
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### Get Specific Team of a User

To obtain details of a specific team that a user belongs to, use the `getTeam` method or `useTeam` hook. Note, this may return `null` if the user is not a member of the team. Here is an example:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Client Component">
    ```tsx focus={5-10} title="Get a specific team of a user on the client"
    "use client";
    import { useUser } from "@stackframe/stack";

    export function DisplayUserTeam(props: { teamId: string }) {
      const user = useUser({ or: 'redirect' });
      const team = user.useTeam(props.teamId);

      return <div>
        {team ? team.displayName : 'Not a member of this team'}
      </div>;
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Server Component">
    ```tsx focus={4-9} title="Get a specific team of a user on the server"
    import { stackServerApp } from "@/stack";

    export default async function DisplayUserTeam(props: { teamId: string }) {
      const user = await stackServerApp.getUser({ or: 'redirect' });
      const team = await user.getTeam(props.teamId);

      return <div>
        {team ? team.displayName : 'Not a member of this team'}
      </div>;
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### List All the Teams

To list all the teams, you can call the `listTeams` method on the `stackServerApp`, this is an example:

```tsx
const teams = await stackServerApp.listTeams();
```

### Update a Team

To update a team, use the `update` method on a server-side team object. Here is an example:

```tsx
const team = await stackServerApp.getTeam('teamId');
await team.update({
  displayName: 'New Team Name',
});
```

### Remove a User from a Team

To remove a user from a team, you can call the `removeUserFromTeam` method on the `stackServerApp`, this is an example:

```tsx
await stackServerApp.removeUserFromTeam({
  teamId: team.id,
  userId: user.id,
});
```

### List All the Members of a Team

To list all the members of a team, you can call the `listMembers` method on a server side team object. Note that the returned result is a list of `TeamMember` objects, from which you can also get the user object. This is an example:

```tsx
const team = await stackServerApp.getTeam('teamId');
const members = await team.listMembers();
for (const member of members) {
  const user = await member.getUser();
  console.log(user.displayName, 'is a member of', team.displayName);
}
```

## Permissions

Permissions control what each user can do within your application. Create permissions on the Stack dashboard and assign them to users. You can then verify in your app whether a user has a specific permission.

Permissions can be nested, allowing you to create a hierarchical structure. For instance, an `admin` permission can include `moderator` and `user` permissions. We provide tools to help you verify whether a user has a permission directly or indirectly.


### Check if a User has a Permission

You can check if a user has a specific permission by using the `getPermission` method or `usePermission` hook on the `User` object. This returns the `Permission` object if the user has it; otherwise, it returns `null`. Be cautious with client-side checks for permissions, as they can be bypassed. Always perform permission checks on the server side for business logic. Here is an example:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Client Component">
    ```tsx focus={5-11} title="Check user permission on the client"
    "use client";
    import { useUser } from "@stackframe/stack";

    export function CheckUserPermission() {
      const user = useUser({ or: 'redirect' });
      const permission = user.usePermission('read');

      // Don't rely on client side permission checks for business logic
      return <div>
        {permission ? 'You have the read permission' : 'You shall not pass'}
      </div>;
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Server Component">
    ```tsx focus={4-10} title="Check user permission on the server"
    import { stackServerApp } from "@/stack";

    export default async function CheckUserPermission() {
      const user = await stackServerApp.getUser({ or: 'redirect' });
      const permission = await user.getPermission('read');

      // This is a server side check, so it's secure
      return <div>
        {permission ? 'You have the read permission' : 'You shall not pass'}
      </div>;
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### List All the Permissions of a User

To get all permissions a user has, use the `listPermissions` method or `usePermissions` hook on the User object. This method retrieves all direct and indirect permissions. Here is an example:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Client Component" default>
    ```tsx focus={5-10} title="List user permissions on the client"
    "use client";
    import { useUser } from "@stackframe/stack";

    export function DisplayUserPermissions() {
      const user = useUser({ or: 'redirect' });
      const permissions = user.usePermissions();

      return <div>
        {permissions.map(permission => <div key={permission.id}>{permission.id}</div>)}
      </div>;
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Server Component">
    ```tsx focus={4-9} title="List user permissions on the server"
    import { stackServerApp } from "@/stack";

    export default async function DisplayUserPermissions() {
      const user = await stackServerApp.getUser({ or: 'redirect' });
      const permissions = await user.listPermissions();

      return <div>
        {permissions.map(permission => <div key={permission.id}>{permission.id}</div>)}
      </div>;
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Grant a Permission to a User

To grant a permission to a user, you can call the `grantPermission` method on the `ServerUser`. Here is an example:

```tsx
const team = await stackServerApp.getTeam('teamId');
const user = await stackServerApp.getUser();
await user.grantPermission(team, 'read');
```

### Revoke a Permission from a User

To revoke a permission from a user, you can call the `revokePermission` method on the `ServerUser`. Here is an example:

```tsx
const team = await stackServerApp.getTeam('teamId');
const user = await stackServerApp.getUser();
await user.revokePermission(team, 'read');
```
