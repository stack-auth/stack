In [the last guide](./setup.mdx), we initialized Stack. This time, we will take a quick look at some of the most useful Next.js components.

For the full documentation of all available components, please refer to the [SDK reference](/docs/sdk).

## `<UserButton />`

The `<UserButton />` component shows the user's avatar and opens a dropdown with various user settings.

![UserButton](../imgs/user-button.png)

```tsx title="page.tsx"
import { UserButton } from '@stackframe/stack';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <UserButton />
  );
}
```

## Next steps

In the next guide, we will do a deep-dive into retrieving and modifying user objects, as well as how to protect a page.
