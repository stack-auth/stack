subtitle: REST API Overview
---

Stack offers a REST API for backends & frontends of any language. This API is used to authenticate users, manage user data, and more.

## Authentication

Stack requires some headers to be sent with each request to authenticate the user:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /" />


## Client vs Server

Stack Auth provides two ways to authenticate the API requests: client and server. 

The client method is normally used for client-side applications, like from a browser or mobile app, the client APIs can only read and update the currently authenticated user's data.

The server method is used for places like your bakend server, admin panel, or your data management scripts. The server APIs can read and update any user's data.
