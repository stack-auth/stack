# Stack

Stack is an open-source, self-hostable, and highly customizable authentication and user management system.

We provide frontend and backend libraries for Next.js, React, and JavaScript. You can set it up in one minute and scale with the project as it grows.

## Features

- Composable React components & hooks
- OAuth (Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.)
- Email and password authentication (with email verification and password reset)
- Easy to set up with proxied providers (no need to sign up and create OAuth endpoints yourself on all the providers)
- User management & analytics
- User-associated metadata with client-/server-specific permissions
- Out-of-the-box Dark/Light mode support
- suports switching out the underlying UI library, support MUI Joy out of the box
- **100% open-source!**

Currently, only Next.js is supported, but we are working on adding other frameworks.

## Installation

To get started with Stack, you need to [create a Next.js project](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) using the App router. Then, you can install Stack by running the following command:

```bash
npm install @stackframe/stack
```

For setup, refer to [our documentation](https://docs.stack-auth.com).
