# Contributing to Stack Auth

Welcome to Stack Auth! We welcome and appreciate contributors from all over the world. However, due to the nature of authentication, this may not be the easiest project to contribute to, so if you are looking for projects to help you gain programming experience, we may not be a great match. However, if you think you're up for the challenge, feel free to join [our Discord](https://discord.stack-auth.com) and get in touch.

# !!! IMPORTANT: WE ARE NOT HIRING.
